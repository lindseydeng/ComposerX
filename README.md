# ComposerX

## Introduction

ComposerX is a multi-agent-based text-to-music generation system powered by GPT where each GPT plays a role in the process of music composition.

This is code for paper "ComposerX: Multi-Agent Symbolic Music Composition with LLMs[here](paper link)

This is our demo page:[here](https://lllindsey0615.github.io/ComposerX_demo/)

For one-time prompt input, run:
```
python multi_agent_pipe.py -p "input your prompt here" -o "directory to store the results"
