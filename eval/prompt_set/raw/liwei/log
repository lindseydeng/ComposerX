Meta prompt: You
I am a prompt engineer and I need to design an instruction prompt to generate multiple text prompts. A text-to-music system takes the generated text prompt to generate music. Now, please give me a detailed instruction prompt thus I can use it to generate multiple diverse and high-quality text prompts. The instruction prompt limits the generated text prompts to 2~5 sentences and one or more of the following properties: genre, tempo, key, chord progression, melody, rhythm, number of bars, number of voices, instruments, style, feeling, emotion, name, motif.

Prompt: Generate a series of unique and imaginative text prompts for musical compositions. Each prompt should be concise, consisting of 2 to 5 sentences. In each prompt, creatively incorporate one or more of the following musical properties: genre, tempo, key, chord progression, melody, rhythm, number of bars, number of voices, instruments, style, feeling, emotion, title, and motif. Ensure that each prompt offers a distinct combination of these elements to inspire a variety of musical pieces. The prompts should be vivid and engaging, painting a clear picture of the desired music piece. Aim for a balance of specificity and creativity to allow composers flexibility while providing clear guidance. Consider different musical genres and moods to ensure a wide range of music styles is covered. Each prompt should be unique, avoiding repetition of themes or musical elements
